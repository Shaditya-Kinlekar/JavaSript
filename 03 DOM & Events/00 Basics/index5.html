        /* explanation:
        Event bubbling is a concept in JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) where when an event (like a click) happens on a nested element (like a child inside a parent), the event doesn't just stay with the child;
        it "bubbles up" through the parent elements as well. So, in your code, if you click on the child element, 
        it triggers the child's click event, and then it also triggers the parent's click event.

        Here's a step-by-step explanation:
        1. You have two HTML elements: a parent and a child. You've attached click event listeners to both of them using JavaScript.
        2. When you click on the child element, the browser registers that click event on the child.
        3. Now, event bubbling comes into play. The browser doesn't stop there; 
        it propagates the click event upwards through the DOM tree, from the child to the parent.
        4. So, first, it triggers the child's click event listener, which logs "Child clicked!" to the console.
        5. Then, it continues bubbling up to the parent element and triggers the parent's click event listener, 
        which logs "Parent clicked!" to the console.

        Now, about `e.stopPropagation()`:
        `e.stopPropagation()` is a way to stop this event bubbling process at a specific point,
        preventing it from continuing to bubble up through the DOM. When you uncomment the line `e.stopPropagation();` 
        in your code and click on the child element, this is what happens:

        1. You click on the child element, and the browser registers the click event on the child.
        2. The child's click event listener runs and logs "Child clicked!" to the console.
        3. Then, when it reaches the line `e.stopPropagation();`, it stops the event from continuing to bubble up.
        4. As a result, the parent's click event listener is not triggered, and "Parent clicked!" is not logged to the console.
        So, `e.stopPropagation()` is like telling the browser, "Hey, don't let this event go any further up the DOM tree."
        It keeps the event contained within the element where it happened, preventing it from affecting parent elements.
