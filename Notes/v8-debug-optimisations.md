# How to Use jsvu and Understand JavaScript Arrays

In this blog post, I will introduce you to **jsvu**, a command-line utility that allows you to easily install and manage multiple JavaScript engines for testing and development purposes. I will also explain how JavaScript arrays are represented and optimized by the V8 engine, one of the most popular and powerful JavaScript engines that powers Chrome and Node.js.

## What is jsvu?

**jsvu** stands for "JavaScript (engine) Version Updater". It is a tool that lets you install and update various JavaScript engines on your machine, such as **V8**, **SpiderMonkey**, **JavaScriptCore**, and **Chakra**. You can use jsvu to switch between different engines and run your JavaScript code with them. This is very useful for testing, debugging, and benchmarking your code across different environments and platforms.

To install jsvu, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system. Then, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install jsvu -g
```

This will install jsvu globally on your machine. You can then run `jsvu` to see the list of available engines and their versions. To install an engine, you can use the `--os` and `--engines` flags. For example, to install the latest version of V8 on Linux, you can run:

```bash
jsvu --os=linux64 --engines=v8
```

This will download and install the V8 binary in your `~/.jsvu` folder. You can then run `v8` to launch the V8 shell and execute your JavaScript code. You can also use the `--help` flag to see more options and usage information.

## How to Debug JavaScript Arrays with V8

One of the features that jsvu provides is the ability to run the V8 shell with the `--allow-natives-syntax` flag. This enables some special syntax and functions that are only available in the V8 engine, and are useful for debugging and inspecting the internal state of JavaScript objects. One of these functions is `%DebugPrint`, which prints a representation of an object's internal structure.

For example, let's create an empty array and print its internal structure using `%DebugPrint`:

```javascript
const myArr = [];
%DebugPrint(myArr);
```

This will output something like this:

```
DebugPrint: 0x2a49ed8219e9: [JSArray]
 - map: 0x2a49ed808299 <Map(PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS)> [FastProperties]
 - prototype: 0x2a49ed8218e9 <JSArray[0]>
 - elements: 0x2a49ed8081f9 <FixedArray[0]> {
    #length: 0
 }
 - length: 0
 - properties: 0x2a49ed8081f9 <FixedArray[0]> {
    #length: 0
 }
```

This output shows us some interesting information about the array, such as its **map**, **prototype**, **elements**, **length**, and **properties**. The most important part for our discussion is the **elements** field, which shows the type and the contents of the array's elements. In this case, the type is **PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS**, which means that the array is optimized for storing small integers (SMIs) in a contiguous block of memory. The contents are empty, since we have not added any elements to the array yet.

### Types of Arrays in V8

In JavaScript, especially within the V8 engine, arrays are categorized into different types based on the kind of elements they contain. These types affect how the arrays are stored and accessed in memory, and how they are optimized by the engine. Understanding these types can help you write more performant and memory-efficient code.

There are two main dimensions that determine the type of an array: **packed** vs **holey**, and **elements kind**.

#### Packed vs Holey Arrays

A **packed** array is an array in which elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory, having no gaps between them. A **holey** array is an array that has gaps between its elements due to deletion or non-contiguous allocation, causing the V8 engine to handle it differently for optimization purposes.

For example, the following arrays are packed and holey, respectively:

```javascript
const continuousArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const holeyArray = [1, , 3, , 5];
```

The difference between packed and holey arrays is not visible in JavaScript code, but it affects how the V8 engine optimizes the array operations. Generally, packed arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than holey arrays, since they avoid the overhead of checking for holes and handling them. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid creating holey arrays whenever possible, and use methods like `Array.prototype.fill` or `Array.prototype.splice` instead of deleting elements or assigning them out of bounds.

#### Elements Kind

The elements kind of an array is determined by the type of the elements that the array contains. V8 supports several elements kinds, such as:

- **SMI**: For small integers in the 31-bit signed integer range, V8 uses a special representation called Small Integer (SMI). Anything that is not a SMI is represented as a HeapObject, which is the address of some entity in memory. For numbers, V8 uses a special kind of HeapObject, the so-called HeapNumber, to represent numbers that arenâ€™t inside the SMI range. SMI is specifically optimized for because small integers are so common in real-world JavaScript programs.
- **Double**: Double arrays are arrays that contain only floating-point numbers. They are still very fast, and given the prevalence of doubles in JavaScript, it is reasonable to assume that all engines have good support for doubles and double arrays.
- **Generic**: Generic arrays are arrays that can contain any type of elements, including objects, strings, symbols, etc. They are the most flexible, but also the slowest and the most memory-consuming, since they require pointers to the elements and additional metadata.

When an array is created, V8 assigns it an initial elements kind based on the type of the first element. For example, if the array is initialized with integers, its elements kind is PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS. Later, adding a floating-point number to the same array transitions it to a more generic elements kind: PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS. Adding a string literal to the array changes its elements kind once again to PACKED_ELEMENTS.

For example, the following code shows how the elements kind of an array changes as we add different types of elements to it:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3]; // elements kind: PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS
array.push(4.56); // elements kind: PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
array.push('x'); // elements kind: PACKED_ELEMENTS
```

These transitions are optimizations done by the JavaScript engine (like V8) and are not visible in JavaScript code. They are intended to improve performance, but they don't change the way you write JavaScript code. However, it is good to be aware of them, and avoid unnecessary transitions that could degrade the performance of your code. For example, if you know that your array will contain only numbers, you can initialize it with a double value, such as `0.0`, to avoid the transition from SMI to Double later.

## How to Access and Optimize JavaScript Arrays

In the previous section, I explained how JavaScript arrays are categorized into different types based on their elements kind and their packed or holey state. In this section, I will show you how to access elements in an array, and how to optimize your arrays for better performance and memory efficiency.

### How to Access Elements in an Array

To access an element in an array, you can use the bracket notation with the index of the element. For example, to access the first element in an array, you can use `arr[0]`. To access the last element in an array, you can use `arr[arr.length - 1]`.

However, what happens if you try to access an element that does not exist in the array? For example, what if you try to access the tenth element in an array that has only five elements? Let's see what happens with the following code:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // currently PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS

arr.push(8.3); // now PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS
arr.push('x'); // now PACKED_ELEMENTS

arr[10] = 982; // now HOLEY_ELEMENTS

console.log(arr[9]);
```

This code creates an array with five elements, then adds two more elements of different types, then assigns a value to the eleventh element, creating a hole in the array. Then, it tries to access the tenth element, which is also a hole. What do you think the output will be?

The answer is `undefined`. To understand why, let's see how the JavaScript engine accesses `arr[9]`:

1. **Bound Check**: First, JavaScript checks if the requested index is within the bounds of the array. Since arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, an index of `9` refers to the tenth element. If the array has fewer than ten elements, the bound check fails, and the result is `undefined`.
2. **Has Own Property Check**: Next, JavaScript checks if the array has an own property with the key `9`. In JavaScript, arrays are objects, and properties can be added to objects dynamically. If the array had an explicit property with the key `9`, this would return the value of that property. However, since we removed the elements added after initialization, the array does not have an own property with the key `9`.
3. **Prototype Chain Check**: If the array does not have an own property with the key `9`, JavaScript proceeds to check the prototype chain. It first checks if `Object.prototype` has a property with the key `9`. Since `Object.prototype` does not have indexed properties, this check also returns `undefined`.
4. **Prototype Chain Continuation**: JavaScript continues checking the prototype chain until it reaches the end without finding a property with the key `9`. Since arrays inherit from `Object.prototype`, and `Object.prototype` does not have indexed properties, the final result is `undefined`.
5. **Return Value**: After completing the above steps, JavaScript returns `undefined` because there is no element at index `9` in the array.

# Understanding the Cost of Holes in JavaScript Arrays

JavaScript arrays are a staple in web development, known for their versatility and ease of use. However, they can sometimes contain "holes," which are essentially empty spaces within the array. These holes can be tricky to deal with and can even slow down your code. Let's break down why holes are costly and how to avoid them.

## How Holes Get Made in JavaScript Arrays

Holes in JavaScript arrays usually happen in two scenarios:

- **Empty Array Initialization**: When you create an array with a set size but don't put any values in it right away, you end up with holes. For example, `const arr1 = new Array(3);` makes an array with three empty spots.
- **Deleting Elements**: If you remove items from an array using the `delete` keyword, you leave behind holes. Like so: `const arr2 = [1, 2, 3]; delete arr2[1];` removes the item at position 1, leaving a hole in its place.

You can tell if an array has holes by using the `in` operator. It will return `false` for any empty slots. So, `1 in arr1` and `1 in arr2` both say `false`, showing that there's nothing at those positions.

## Why Holes Can Be Troublesome

Holes in arrays can cause problems for two big reasons:

- **Slow Down Your Code**: When you try to access or loop through an array with holes, it takes longer because the JavaScript engine has to go looking for the actual values. Imagine trying to find a book in a library where some shelves are missing booksâ€”it's going to take longer than if all the books were neatly arranged.
- **Mess Up Engine Optimizations**: JavaScript engines try to make things run smoothly by optimizing how they handle arrays. But when there are holes, the engine can't do this as well, which can make your code run slower and use more memory.

### Performance of Accessing and Iterating Over Array Elements

Accessing elements in a holey array can be less performant than accessing elements in a continuous array. This is because the JavaScript engine has to traverse the prototype chain to find the actual value, which takes more time compared to accessing elements in a continuous array where the value is directly associated with the index. For example, `arr1[0]` has to look up the value of `0` in the `Array.prototype` object, which is slower than `arr2[0]` which has the value of `1` stored in the array itself.

Additionally, holey arrays can lead to unexpected behavior when iterating over the array with methods like `forEach`, `map`, etc., because these methods skip over the holes. For example, `arr1.forEach(console.log)` does not print anything, while `arr2.forEach(console.log)` prints `1`, `undefined`, and `3`. This can cause bugs and inconsistencies in your code.

### Optimization of Array Operations by the JavaScript Engine

JavaScript engines use different internal representations for arrays depending on their characteristics, such as their size, type, and shape. These representations affect how the engine optimizes array operations, such as accessing, modifying, and iterating over array elements. Generally, the engine prefers arrays that are continuous, homogeneous, and small, because they are easier to optimize and more memory efficient.

The following table shows the optimization order for different kinds of arrays, from most optimized to least optimized:

| Optimization Order | Array Kind        | Example                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1                  | Continuous SMI    | `[42, 23]`                                      |
| 2                  | Continuous DOUBLE | `[4.2, 2 ** 30]`                                |
| 3                  | Continuous PACKED | `[1, "a"]`                                      |
| 4                  | Holey SMI         | `new Array(3); arr[0] = 42; arr[1] = 23;`       |
| 5                  | Holey DOUBLE      | `new Array(3); arr[0] = 4.2; arr[1] = 2 ** 30;` |
| 6                  | Holey PACKED      | `new Array(3); arr[0] = 1; arr[1] = "a";`       |

- SMI stands for Small Integer, which is a 31-bit signed integer that can be stored in a single word of memory.
- DOUBLE stands for Double Precision Floating Point Number, which is a 64-bit number that can represent decimals and large integers.
- PACKED stands for Packed Elements, which means that the array does not have any holes and all elements are defined.
- Holey stands for Holey Elements, which means that the array has holes and some elements are undefined.

As you can see, holey arrays are at the bottom of the optimization order, because they are harder to optimize and more memory intensive. This means that holey arrays can slow down your code and consume more memory than continuous arrays.

### Creating and Managing Holes in JavaScript Arrays

Let's consider two examples of arrays, `arr4` and `arr5`, to illustrate the differences in handling holes.

#### Example: `arr4` with Holes

```javascript
const arr4 = new Array(3); // Creates an array with 3 holes
arr4[0] = '1'; // Fills the first hole
arr4[1] = '2'; // Fills the second hole
arr4[2] = '3'; // Fills the third hole
```

`arr4` starts as a holey array with three empty slots. Once elements are added, it transitions from a holey state to a state that might be less optimized for certain operations. This is because JavaScript engines may not apply certain optimizations to holey arrays due to the need to check for the presence of elements.

#### Example: `arr5` Without Holes

```javascript
const arr5 = []; // Creates an empty array
arr5.push('1'); // Adds an element to the array
arr5.push('2'); // Adds another element to the array
arr5.push('3'); // Adds a third element to the array
```

`arr5` is created as an empty array and elements are added using the `push` method. This results in a packed array without any holes from the start.

### Advantages of Packed Arrays Over Holey Arrays

Packed arrays, like `arr5`, offer several advantages over holey arrays:

1. **Contiguous Memory**: Packed arrays fill array slots sequentially, avoiding holes, which leads to better memory efficiency.
2. **Predictable Layout**: The engine can optimize for contiguous memory access, thereby improving iteration speed.
3. **Correct Iteration**: Methods like `forEach` won't skip over holes, ensuring accurate results during iteration.
4. **Lower Memory Usage**: Packed arrays only use memory for actual elements, unlike holey arrays that reserve space for all indices.
5. **Clearer Code**: Using `push()` to add elements is more intuitive and helps avoid confusion about holes.
