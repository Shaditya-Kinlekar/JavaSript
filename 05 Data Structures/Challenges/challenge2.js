/* 
Let's continue with our football betting app!

1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
    Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
    Odd of draw: 3.25
    Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). HINT: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
    {
        Gnarby: 1,
        Hummels: 1,
        Lewandowski: 2
    }

/* 
    scorers[player] ? scorers[player]++ : (scorers[player] = 1);
        This line uses a ternary operator to update the scorers object for each player.
        The player variable represents the current player's name in the iteration.
        The ternary operator checks whether the player name exists as a property in the scorers object:
            If the property exists (i.e., scorers[player] is truthy), it increments the value associated with that player using scorers[player]++. This represents another goal scored by the same player.
            If the property doesn't exist (i.e., scorers[player] is falsy), it assigns the value 1 to that property. This represents the first goal scored by the player.
